#### Step 1: Prepare Your Content
1. **Open TimeTravelAR** on your device
2. **Have a test photo ready** (or use the demo image)
3. **Clear your screen** - close unnecessary apps
4. **Set phone to Do Not Disturb** to avoid notifications

#### Step 2: Set Up Recording
**iOS:**
- Go to Settings → Control Center → Add "Screen Recording"
- Swipe down from top-right → Tap record button
- Wait 3 seconds for countdown

**Android:**
- Swipe down notification panel
- Find "Screen Recorder" or use built-in recorder
- Some devices: Settings → Advanced → Screenshots & screen recorder

**Third-party apps:**
- iOS: Use built-in screen recorder (recommended)
- Android: AZ Screen Recorder, DU Recorder, or built-in

#### Step 3: Record the Process
1. **Start recording** (3-second countdown)
2. **Upload photo** - Show the upload button being tapped
3. **Select style** - Show dropdown/selection (2-3 seconds)
4. **Processing** - Let it process fully (10-15 seconds)
5. **Reveal** - Show before/after side-by-side (3-5 seconds)
6. **Stop recording** - End with app logo or CTA

#### Step 4: Editing Tips
- **Trim** beginning/end (remove countdown, awkward pauses)
- **Add text overlays** at key moments:
  - "Uploading..." during upload
  - "Processing..." during AI work
  - "Your future self!" at reveal
- **Speed up** processing if it's too long (1.5x-2x speed)
- **Add music** - Use trending audio or royalty-free tracks
- **Add transitions** - Smooth cuts between steps

#### Step 5: Best Practices
- **Keep it under 30 seconds** for Reels/Shorts
- **Start with hook** - Show result first, then process (or vice versa)
- **Use captions** - Many watch without sound
- **Add effects** - Zoom, transitions, text animations
- **End with CTA** - "Try it now — link in bio"

#### Step 6: Export Settings
